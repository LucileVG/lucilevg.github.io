I'm a PhD student in population genetics at UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ©. I use statistical physics and bioinformatics to analyse patterns of mutation and model bacterial evolution.

My work focuses on the short and long term evolution of _Escherichia coli_, using 60,000 genomes to uncover mechanisms of patho-adaptation and acquisition of antibiotic resistance. I sometimes change scale from genetics to the dynamics of microbial communities in the human gut.
